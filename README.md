# Every-Chess-Move-on-a-Board
See README for description
This large helper function takes a "chess board grid" as input, which is a list of list of either None, or python objects representing chess pieces. Based on the board's layout, this function returns every possible legal move that white can make. This accounts for moves that would leave the king in check, and will not include any such moves in the final output. This was written for an ongoing project aiming to run a small chess engine on IBM's qiskit, which simulates quantum computers. This would be a helper function that would run classically for a project that aimed to run chess on a quantum computer.
